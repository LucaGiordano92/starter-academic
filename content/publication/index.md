title: "Exploitation of Prunus mahaleb fruit by fermentation with selected strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae"

abstract: "The organoleptic attributes of Prunus mahaleb, 
a fruit representing a new source of bioactive compounds, 
are so pronounced that it can be consider non-edible. 
This study was designed to evaluate the acceptance of 
P. mahaleb fruits after fermentation with different Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
and Lactobacillus plantarum protechnological strains. Four different bacterial 
and one yeast strains, as single or mixed starter formulation, were used to inoculate 
an aqueous suspension of P. mahaleb fruits. The fermented fruits and fermentation broths 
were subjected to physico-chemical characterization and the organoleptic properties of both samples
were also assessed by a hedonic panel. 
The obtained results indicated that all the employed strains were able to grow and to ferment the matrix. 
However, the mixed starter FG69 + Li180-7 (L. plantarum/S. cerevisiae) had the best impact on sensory characteristics of 
P. mahaleb fruit and fermented medium. The adopted protocol allowed us to attain edible fruits and a new fermented non-dairy 
drink with valuable probiotic health-promoting properties. In our knowledge, this is the first study concerning the exploitation of 
P. mahaleb fruits. This investigation confirmed the potential of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria co-inoculation in the design of starter 
tailored for this kind of food applications."
